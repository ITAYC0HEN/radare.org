radare2 was created in February 2006, aiming to provide a free and simple command line interface for
a hexadecimal editor supporting 64 bit offsets to make searches and recovering data from hard-disks,
for forensic purpose.
	
Since then, the project has grown with the aim changed to provide a complete framework
for analysing binaries with some basic *NIX concepts in mind like 'everything is a file',
'small programs that interact together using stdin/out' or 'keep it simple'.

In 2009, the decision was made to completely rewrite it,
to get around limitations in the initial design. Since then, the project kept growing,
attracting several resident developers.
