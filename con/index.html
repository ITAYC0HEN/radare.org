<h1>What</h1>
The first public and international congress about <a href="http://rada.re/">radare</a>.
<br />
<br />
Highlighting all aspects of radare2, this congress brings the oportunity to everyone to learn more about manual and automated reverse engineering, static and dynamic analysis, fuzzing, forensics, exploiting, unpacking, malware, ... this congress allows everyone to understand how to use r2 and how to extend it for your own purposes, it will also serve as an excuse for all developers to meet and discuss design and implementation tips for the future of the project.
<br />
<br />
The congress will be composed by 2 days trainings (english and spanish) and a single track of talks with parallel chill zone with beers for chatting and socializing.
<br />
<br />
<h1>Why</h1>
Because in 2016, the radare project turns 10 year old and the community and interest is big enough to fill a conference.
<h1>When</h1>
September 8, 9, 10
<h1>Where</h1>
Barcelona
<h1>Who</h1>
Everyone: from hackers to developers, from users to companies, from curious to experts.
<h1>Price</h1>
In order to estimate the amount of people and dimensionate the space the entrance there will be a pre-order of 10e, but the final ticket price is not yet defined, but will be an affordable for everyone.
<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
The talks and trainings in r2con must involve r2 in some way or another, we are not imposing any strict topic, the August's 1st we will publish the schedule with all the accepted talks.
