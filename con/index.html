<h1>What</h1>
The first public and international congress about <a href="http://rada.re/">radare</a>.
<br />
<br />
Highlighting all aspects of radare2, this congress brings the oportunity to everyone to learn more about manual and automated reverse engineering, static and dynamic analysis, fuzzing, forensics, exploiting, unpacking, malware, ... this congress allows everyone to understand how to use r2 and how to extend it for your own purposes, it will also serve as an excuse for all developers to meet and discuss design and implementation tips for the future of the project.
<br /> <br />
The congress will be composed by 2 days of trainings (english and spanish) and a single track of talks with parallel chill zone with beers for chatting and socializing.

<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
The talks and trainings in r2con must involve r2 in some way or another, we are not imposing any strict topic, the August's 1st we will publish the schedule with all the accepted talks.
<br /><br />
You can send your talk proposals (45m of duration) to <a href="mailto:r2con@radare.org">r2con@radare.org</a>

<br />
<br />
<h1>Why</h1>
Because in 2016, the radare project turns 10 year old and the community and interest is big enough to fill a conference.
<h1>When</h1>
September 8, 9, 10
<h1>Where</h1>
The event will happen in <a href="http://www.aureasocial.org/">AureaSocial</a>, Carrer de Sardenya, 263, 08013 Barcelona
<br />

<h1>Who</h1>
Everyone: from hackers to developers, from users to companies, from curious to experts.
<br /> <br />
Tickets are now available at <a href="http://www.eventzilla.net/web/event?eventid=2138852672">this page</a>.
<br /> <br />
Tickets bought before August 15th will be rewarded with some r2 merchandising from <a href="http://camisetasfrikis.es/31-radare">Camisetas Frikis</a>
<br /> <br />

<h1>8th Thursday Trainings</h1>
The following trainings are included with the ticket and performed during 8th and 9th morning:
<br /><br/>

<b>Thu 8 - Track 1 - 10:00 / 14:00 Introduction to radare2 (xvilka + jvoisin + maijin) (EN)</b>
<p>
This training will explain in detail how to use radare2 for reverse engineering binaries providing different examples and common use cases to follow the learning.
</p>

<b>Thu 8 - Track 2 - 10:00 / 14:00 Radare from A to Z (pancake) (EN)</b>
<p>
By the hand of the author of radare and radare2, this training will cover all the features of the tool and the framework, from the history, commands syntax, libraries, plugins and features with some examples to get in touch with all those functionalities.
</p>

<b>Thu 8 - Track 1 - 16:00 / 20:00 Exploiting on Linux (Nighterman) (EN)</b>
<p>
During this training we will show how r2 can help you during the exploitation phase to create shellcodes, ropchains, etc... Also we will cover the usage of rarun2 or the creation of your own r2pipescripts to aid you in the exploitation process. The requirements for the training are: Latest r2 from git (ha!) and a linux (preferably GNU/Debian Sid)
</p>
<b>Thu 8 - Track 2 - 16:00 / 20:00 Plugin development and ESIL (skuater) (SP)</b><br />
<p>
This training will show how to create IO, DEBUG and ANALysis plugins to help us in different reverse engineering tasks: Implement new archs in ESIL for emulation, a new debugger backend to interact with BOCHS and writing a new IO plugin to read/write kernel memory on Windows.
</p>

<h1>9th Friday Morning Training</h1>

<b>Fri 9 - Track 1 - 10:00 / 14:00 AVR exploiting (alexander + boris) (EN)</b><br />
<p>
During this workshop, you will learn about reverse engineering AVR firmware and exploitation specifics. Alexander and Boris will talk about tools and techniques, review AVR architecture, teach you how to write ROP chains for AVR, and use other methods that force MCUs to do things that firmware developers didnâ€™t expect. Post-exploitation topics (like re-flashing and altering the bootloader) will also be covered.  The journey will start with simple programs, quickly advance to different AVR libc and compilers, including some AVR RTOSes and popular Arduino libraries, and finish with a real-world case of industrial gateway exploitation.
<br /><br/>
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of memory corruption (buffer overflow) vulnerabilities and embedded (or ICS) device architecture, Ability to read/understand C code would be great, but not mandatory and a laptop with VMWare/VirtualBox installed (a virtual machine with all required software will be supplied).

<br /><br/>
